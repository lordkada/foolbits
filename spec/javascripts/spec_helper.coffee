# Teaspoon includes some support files, but you can use anything from your own support path too.
# require support/expect
# require support/sinon
# require support/your-support-file
#
# Deferring execution
# If you're using CommonJS, RequireJS or some other asynchronous library you can defer execution. Call Teaspoon.execute()
# after everything has been loaded. Simple example of a timeout:
#
# Teaspoon.defer = true
# setTimeout(Teaspoon.execute, 1000)
#
# Matching files
# By default Teaspoon will look for files that match _spec.{js,js.coffee,.coffee}. Add a filename_spec.js file in your
# spec path and it'll be included in the default suite automatically. If you want to customize suites, check out the
# configuration in config/initializers/teaspoon.rb
#
# Manifest
# If you'd rather require your spec files manually (to control order for instance) you can disable the suite matcher in
# the configuration and use this file as a manifest.

# You can require javascript files here. A good place to start is by requiring your application.js.
